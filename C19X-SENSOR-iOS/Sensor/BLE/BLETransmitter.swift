/**
 Transmitter offers three services:
 1. Signal characteristic for maintaining connection between iOS devices and also enable non-transmitting Android devices (receive only,
 like the Samsung J6) to make their presence known by writing their beacon code and RSSI as data to this characteristic.
 2. Payload characteristic for publishing beacon identity data.
 3. Payload sharing characteristic for publishing beacon identity data recently acquired by this beacon.
 
 Keeping the transmitter and receiver working in iOS background mode is a major challenge, in particular when both
 iOS devices are in background mode. The transmitter on iOS offers a notifying beacon characteristic that is triggered
 by writing anything to the characteristic. On characteristic write, the transmitter will call updateValue after 8 seconds
 to notify the receivers, to wake up the receivers with a didUpdateValueFor call. The process can repeat as a loop
 between the transmitter and receiver to keep both devices awake. This is unnecessary for Android-Android and also
 Android-iOS and iOS-Android detection, which can rely solely on scanForPeripherals for detection.
 
 The notification based wake up method relies on an open connection which seems to be fine for iOS but may cause
 problems for Android. Experiments have found that Android devices cannot accept new connections (without explicit
 disconnect) indefinitely and the bluetooth stack ceases to function after around 500 open connections. The device
 will need to be rebooted to recover. However, if each connection is disconnected, the bluetooth stack can work
 indefinitely, but frequent connect and disconnect can still cause the same problem. The recommendation is to
 (1) always disconnect from Android as soon as the work is complete, (2) minimise the number of connections to
 an Android device, and (3) maximise time interval between connections. With all these in mind, the transmitter
 on Android does not support notify and also a connect is only performed on first contact to get the bacon code.
